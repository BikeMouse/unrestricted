This is a static React site, build on the principles of components, displaying services a mobile bike mechanic offer.

PLEASE NOTE THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT


## How It Is Done
Techs used: React, Vite, ,Tailwind CSS, Express (backend)

Vite:
Using the command line, navigate into the folder with all your projects, if you are using npm type in "npm create vite@latest"
for other package managers, follow the link https://vitejs.dev/guide/ for scaffolding your project.

Once the project has been scaffolded, in which you are setting up your project name and libraries used, navigate into the project folder and use the following commands:
    npm install
    npm run dev

That will produce a link to a localhost port on which you can view your project you are building and Vite provides with a core of files which you can use to get started on your project.

That is only for the frontend.

A backend has been created - using express (so this will need to be installed as well) - to start the server (and also seeing the result on Localhost) type in 'node index.js'.
