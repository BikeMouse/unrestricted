        description: "Over time, chains and cassettes do wear out and will affect our shifting. When the gears start skipping, it is usually down to a worn chain, cassette or both. The type of chain or cassette you will need depends on the amount of gears you have. To determine how many gears you got, count the sprockets on your rear wheel. The other detail to look out for is the Discipline: Road and Mountain Bikes have different needs in regards to the chain and cassette. So when ordering a chain, cassette or both, please tell us the Discipline that you need.",

        description: "Disc Brake Pads are the small parts that sandwich the Brake Rotor and stop the wheel. Due to riding conditions- muddy, rainy, etc- all sorts of grime and grease get sprayed at the brake rotors and pads. Through that and normal wear and tear, brake pads and rotors do wear down - like the chain. So you may find that you don't have the braking power as you used to have and/or your braking makes awful noises. Chances are that your pads are contaminated and/or worn down and need replaced. We have the common range of pads stocked. Please get in touch with us! When you do, please tell us the Brand (Shimano,Sram, Tektro etc) and -if known- the compound of the brake pad.",
